# Movie Recommendation system


## Description
A brief overview of the project:
- What does it do?
  - This application will allow you to pull from the imdb database and find recommendations to new films to watch. 
  - You can filter the desired content
  - you can stipulate those movies that you have liked or watched before and the system will recommend to you movies that you should like
  - Then the system will recommend movies
- Why was it built?
- What problem does it solve?
  - On those nights where you and perhaps those you love are looking for a movie and trawling through the endless lists of movies
  - Even if they are catagorised by genre, they are never quite what you are looking for.
  - They are:
    - limited by the platform that you are streaming from
    - they are sometimes pushing those movies that they produced internally
    - They offer choice, and recommendations, but not always surprise
